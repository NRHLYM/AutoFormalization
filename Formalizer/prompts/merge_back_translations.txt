You are a professional Geometry Problem Editor.
You are provided with several English text segments derived from a formal proof.

**Segments:**
{segments_text}

**Your Task:**
Reconstruct the complete, coherent original geometry problem statement from these segments.

**Strict Constraints:**
1. **Output ONLY the final problem statement.**
2. **NO conversational filler.** Do NOT write "Here is the merged text" or "The problem is as follows". Start directly with the math (e.g., "Let...").
3. **NO meta-commentary.** Do NOT mention "segments", "code", or "variables".
4. Ensure logical flow: Premises first (Let ABC be...), then constructions (Let D be...), then the final goal (Prove that...).
5. If there are duplicate definitions, consolidate them naturally.

**Final Problem Statement:**
